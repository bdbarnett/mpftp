# mpftp User Guide

## What is mpftp?

**mpftp** is a VS Code / Cursor extension for working with [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) boards over USB serial. It gives you a dual-pane file transfer UI, an ANSI REPL, and a guided Firmware panel for downloading or building and flashing board images.

It is maintained under the [PyDevices](https://github.com/PyDevices) organization.

## What problem it solves

MicroPython boards are usually driven with several separate tools: a serial terminal, `mpremote` or an FTP-like client for files, and a makefile/IDF/emsdk toolchain for firmware. Switching between them is slow, and on WSL the host often cannot see Windows `COM` ports without extra USB bridging.

mpftp puts connect, files, REPL, and firmware in one extension host session, with a single serial ownership model so the UI and agents do not fight over the port.

## How it works

- A long-lived **Python sidecar** (`mpremote`-backed) owns the serial link and speaks JSON-lines to the extension.
- **File Transfer** and **REPL** talk to that session.
- **Firmware** build/flash runs as a separate host-side Python engine so compiles never hold the serial port longer than needed.
- On **WSL**, serial and esp32 flash use **Windows Python** so `COM` ports work without `usbipd`.

## Getting started

### Requirements

- VS Code or Cursor
- Python 3 with [`mpremote`](https://pypi.org/project/mpremote/)
  - **Windows / WSL:** install `mpremote` for Windows Python (`python.exe -m pip install mpremote`)
  - **Native Linux:** `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install mpremote`, or set `mpftp.pythonPath`

### Install

1. Install the extension from the Marketplace (`pydevices.mpftp`) or from a `.vsix` (**Extensions: Install from VSIX…**).
2. Reload the window if prompted.
3. Click the **mpftp** status bar item or run **mpftp: Connect to Board**.

### Connect and transfer files

1. Connect and pick a serial port (`COM4`, `/dev/ttyACM0`, …).
2. Open **File Transfer** (editor tab or panel).
3. Drag files between local and board panes, or use the header actions.
4. Double-click a board file to edit it; save writes it back (optional SHA-256 verify).

### REPL

**mpftp: Open REPL** opens a terminal attached to the same session (ANSI colors supported). Interrupt / soft reset / hard reset are available as commands.

### Firmware workspace (Build)

Official **Download** mode needs no local checkout.

**Build** mode needs a **firmware workspace**: a folder that contains `micropython/` (directory or symlink) or that *is* the MicroPython tree (`ports/` and `py/`).

Optional in that workspace:

- `micropython.cmake` / `manifest.py` — aggregators for user modules and frozen Python (Create stubs… if missing); see [aggregator.md](aggregator.md)
- Any **port dependency** trees you need (for example `esp-idf`, `emsdk`) as directories or symlinks

Dependencies that are not in the workspace must be provided via their environment variables (for example `IDF_PATH`, `EMSDK`) or the Locate… prompt when you build.

Discovery order for MicroPython: settings → `MP_DIR` → `~/micropython` → editor open folders → Choose workspace….

### Download vs Build

| Mode | Use when |
|------|----------|
| **Download** | You want an official micropython.org binary (Thonny catalog) |
| **Build** | You have a MicroPython tree and want a custom firmware (user modules, partitions, …) |

**Detect** uses esptool first (works on a bare board), then optionally enriches from a live MicroPython session.

User modules / aggregators: **[aggregator.md](aggregator.md)**.

### ESP32 partition autosize

esp32 builds can fail when the firmware image is larger than the app (`factory`)
partition in the board’s partition table. mpftp handles that automatically:

1. Parse the ESP-IDF error (`app partition is too small … (overflow …)`).
2. Grow the app partition (aligned) and reflow following partitions.
3. Write the override to **`<firmware-workspace>/esp32_partitions/<board>.csv`**
   (or `<board>-<variant>.csv`). The MicroPython checkout is **not** modified.
4. Point the build-dir `sdkconfig` at that CSV (path relative to `ports/esp32`:
   `../../../esp32_partitions/…`) and rebuild **once**.

There is no manual partition slider in the Firmware UI. Scripted overrides remain
available via `./scripts/mpftp firmware partitions …`. Pass `--no-autosize` on
the build engine/CLI to disable the automatic grow-and-retry.

If the on-device partition layout differs from the artifact at flash time, mpftp
**stops and warns** instead of erasing automatically. Enable **Erase flash before
writing** and click **Flash** again. A full erase wipes the filesystem
(**vfs** / storage) partition — all files on the board will be lost.

## Settings (high level)

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `mpftp.workspacePath` | Firmware workspace (MicroPython + optional SDK symlinks) |
| `mpftp.micropythonPath` | Optional override of the MicroPython tree |
| `mpftp.idfPath` / `mpftp.emsdkPath` | Optional SDK overrides |
| `mpftp.pythonPath` | Serial/sidecar Python (on WSL, leave empty for Windows `python.exe`) |
| `mpftp.buildPythonPath` | Native Python for the build engine |
| `mpftp.verifyTransfers` | SHA-256 after transfers |
| `mpftp.autoReconnectAfterReset` | Reconnect after hard reset |

## Troubleshooting

- **Listing ports then nothing / connect fails:** another tool may hold the port; close it. After a bad flash, the filesystem may be corrupt — erase and reflash.
- **WSL cannot see COM ports:** ensure Windows Python + `mpremote` are installed; mpftp should not need `usbipd`.
- **Build missing a tree:** set the env var, symlink the repo under the firmware workspace, or use Locate….
- **ESP-IDF version mismatch:** Install instructions follow the version recommended in `ports/esp32/README.md` for your checkout.
- **App partition too small:** autosize grows `esp32_partitions/<board>.csv` and rebuilds once (see [Autosize](#esp32-partition-autosize)); use `--no-autosize` only if you are managing the table yourself.
